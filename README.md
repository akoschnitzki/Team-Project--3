# Team-Project--3


Dear World,

In this project, we worked as a team to be able to show how this code was able to work. We 
were able to comment for each part what the code does and why it is important for it all to be 
able to run. We all had different parts that we had to comment and we all were able to tell 
what this code is able to do. The code is able to create a calculator and it is able to run 
and work.

From Our Team.
